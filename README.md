# Web Proposal System

Sprint ID: 3
Core Bet: Interactive web proposals with animations + Groq AI on ajteconomics.co.uk

## What We're Building

Transform the QMD proposal workflow into a slick web experience:
1. **Input**: Quick form in mindmap dashboard
2. **AI Enhancement**: Groq expands bullet points to full sections  
3. **Output**: Animated web proposal at `ajteconomics.co.uk/proposals/[client-name]`
4. **Tracking**: Know when they view it, what they read, how long they spend

## Why This Matters

- Current: Manual QMD â†’ DOCX (just shipped one tonight)
- Future: 5-minute proposal generation with professional animations
- Inspired by: Pylon's solar proposal system

## Success Metrics

- Time to create proposal: <5 minutes
- Looks professional as fuck
- Client engagement tracked
- Reusable for future proposals

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS with animations (steal from dashboard)
- **AI**: Groq API for content generation
- **Hosting**: Netlify (connected to ajteconomics.co.uk)
- **Analytics**: Simple view tracking + Netlify Analytics

## Next Steps

1. Create minimal proposal template
2. Add Groq integration 
3. Deploy to Netlify
4. Connect domain
5. Add tracking
